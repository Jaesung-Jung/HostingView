# HostingView

SwiftUI is Apple's modern UI framework. While SwiftUI has come a long way since it was first released, it still lacks the ability to fully control every UI element in great detail, which is why many developers still use UIKit or partially use SwiftUI.

Apple provides a way to integrate UIKit and SwiftUI, but using the `UIHostingController` within the `UIView` hierarchy can be a bit cumbersome.

In iOS 16, Apple introduced `UIHostingConfiguration` as a new way to integrate SwiftUI with UICollectionViewCell and UITableViewCell. Inspired by this, I created `HostingView`.

This package provides two ways to integrate SwiftUI: `HostingView` and `StatefulHostingView<State>`.

#### ðŸ’¬ ... Why should we use this package instead of UIHostingConfiguration?
- When using UIHostingConfiguration to create a CustomView (not a Cell) and applying Auto Layout, intrinsicContentSize may not be calculated correctly. This package properly calculates the content size and works seamlessly with Auto Layout.

- The most powerful aspect is when using StatefulHostingView to create a CustomView or CustomControl. It allows you to easily leverage SwiftUIâ€™s features and the benefits of declarative programming within UIKit. The demo project includes an [implementation of UISwitch](https://github.com/Jaesung-Jung/HostingView/blob/5856ea1a8cf7b5c804096293d353c8727c7828de/Demo/HostingViewDemo/Menu/CustomControlViewController.swift#L93) with little code using SwiftUI. The demo also demonstrates the bounce effect and On/Off animation.

- More simple than UIHostingConfiguration or UIHostingController.

## HostingView
You can wrap a stateless SwiftUI view.
```swift
let gradientText = HostingView {
  Text("Hosting View")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .fontWeight(.black)
    .foregroundStyle(
      .linearGradient(
        colors: [.cyan, .indigo, .pink, .orange, .yellow],
        startPoint: .topLeading,
        endPoint: .bottomTrailing
      )
    )
}
```
The `intrinsicContentSize` is also correctly calculated, ensuring that the view behaves appropriately according to the size provided by the SwiftUI view.

## StatefulHostingView
You can wrap a stateful SwiftUI view, and SwiftUI will re-render the view whenever it detects a state change.
```swift
let statefulText = StatefulHostingView(state: 1) { state in // 1 is initial value
  VStack {
    Text("Stateful Hosting View")
      .font(.headline)
      .fontWeight(.black)

    Text("State is \(state)")
      .font(.subheadline)
      .fontWeight(.medium)
      .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
  }
}

statefulText.state = 100 // When the state changes, SwiftUI re-renders the view.
```
